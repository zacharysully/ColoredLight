Rules on populating the scene:

1. You can only use a certain Letters and only in Caps right now

2. You can only put one Letter per Seperator

3. Seperate all letters by a slash "/". If it breaks, you used the wrong slash (NO SPACES, ENTERS OKAY)

4a. To get the Text document to work, place it into the "TextLevels" folder 
4b. Then drag from Resources->Prefabs->WorldHolder.prefab into the scene
4c. In the Inspector there is a field for LevelName, this is case-sensitive, must be the same 


SYMBOLS(Letters) LIST:
/ = Seperator, put one in between every letter unless is the last letter in the line

O = open floor tile
X = no tile, no floor, is a pit, is empty (whatever you wanna classify it as)
P* = player (you can put as many as you want since we dont have movement yet)
B = Block (basic pushable object)

*putting a player puts a floor tile underneath him, dont O/OP/O
